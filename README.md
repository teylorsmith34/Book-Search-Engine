# Book-Search-Engine
-----
## Description


This is a book search engine. Users can search for a book and save it to a list. 


-----


## Usage



This was already a fully functioning Google Books API search engine built with a RESTful API. I have refactored it to be a GraphQL API built with Apollo Server. The app was built using the MERN stack, with a React front end, MongoDB database, and Node.js/Express.js server and API.
